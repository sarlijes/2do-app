# Todo App - Portfolio Project

**Technologies:** Flask, React, react-router, MUI, Emotion, Vite

The project is based on a reused study [project template](https://gitlab.jyu.fi/startuplab/courses/tjts5901-continuous-software-engineering/TJTS5901-K23_template), which has been [licensed for reuse](https://gitlab.jyu.fi/startuplab/courses/tjts5901-continuous-software-engineering/TJTS5901-K23_template/-/blob/main/LICENSE). The template contains the changes to the commit [2227f04](https://github.com/sarlijes/2do-app/commit/2227f049e7c11a34331007810e4019867c56ff33). Further development has been done by myself.

## How to develop - starting the app

```sh
docker-compose build

```
